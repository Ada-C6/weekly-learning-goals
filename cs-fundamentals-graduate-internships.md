# Graduate Internships

## About

Some Ada graduates return to Ada for a 2nd internship.  This program is similar to the standard internship students enter as part of the program.  As part of their graduate internship, students take a self-directed course of study in data structures & Algorithms.  The course material  comes from the [Massachussets Institute of Technology course Introduction to Algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/index.htm).  Students will be expected to complete watch lessons, readings and homework and discuss/review the content with an instructor and other students in the program for 1 hr per week.  After completing the curriculum students will begin a program of interview preparation and mentoring.

## Expected Outcomes

The goal of the program is to support students who may have struggled entering industry: providing them both strong interview skills to land an initial position, practice learning independently, and a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms which will support their long-term growth as software engineers. 

In this program students will:

- Demonstrate confidence and skill in taking interview questions and solve them using advanced data structures.
- Design complicated data structures and use them to solve computer science problems
- Explain how specific data structures work and demonstrate use-cases.
- Select efficient data structure or algorithm to solve programming problems
- Demonstrate an ability to learn material independently and discuss content with others
