# HW Learning Goal Label Key
This document describes the labels we give some of our homework assignments. These labels should help a student understand what the learning goal of the assignment.

Often, we will assign homework in the following or similar structure:

```
3. Read about writing pseudocode: [R] https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/
```

The first portion is an explanation of the assignment. The second portion is a label corresponding to our intended learning goal of the reading. The third portion is a link to the resource.

The labels in the second portion map to the following goals:

Label | Learning Goal
:--- | :---
R | Reinforcement
S | Supplementing, adding, or extending Context
N | New material that will be immediately relevant

Here is a brief description of each label:

## Reinforcement [R]

An assignment with the Reinforcement [R] label indicates that the goal of the reading is to go over a concept that has already been introduced into the curriculum.

## Supplementing, Adding, or Extending Context [S]

When an assignment has this label, it serves to add additional context to familiar concepts. Materials and assignments with this label will likely increase and round-out your understanding of a topic. It gives either a different way of looking at a concept, explains a concept more holistically, or shares a way that the concept is applied in a practical way.

## New Material and Immediately Relevant [N]

Reading with this label usually indicates that it is introducing a new concept and new material. If we are assigning new material as reading homework, it will become immediately relevant, likely the very next day.

At Ada, we tend to only briefly review reading homework with this label.

These are the materials we consider to be the most important to our curriculum. If you read nothing else, read the [N]s.

# Nota Bene
Not every assignment will have a label; assignments without a label should, by default, be treated as mandatory new material.

As a guideline, these labels will usually only be applied to reading assignments or assignments to watch a live code.
