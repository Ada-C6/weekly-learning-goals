# Ada Rule of Three
This document describes the three stages of projects that we assign during the classroom curriculum. Each stage describes a different level of expected knowledge and independence.

## Stage 1
- Closely follows in-class examples
- Introduces new concepts
- Individual
- Project definition provides:
  - Full specification of requirements with details around method, data structures, classes, etc.
  - Pre-provided tests (where appropriate)
- Students complete:
  - Code to specification
  - Tests pass

## Stage 2
- Follows some of in-class examples
- Builds off of concepts in stage 1 project
- Individual or pairs
- Project definition provides:
  - User stories
- Students complete:
  - Create the methods and classes based on user stories
  - Code based on created specification
  - Tests

## Stage 3
- Requires critical application of concepts
- Must go beyond in-class examples
- Reinforces previous concepts in stage 1 and 2
- Pairs or teams
- Project definition provides:
  - Requirements that are open to interpretation
- Students complete:
  - Make design decisions
  - Create user stories and project specification
  - Code based on created specification
  - Test
- May not fully complete the project
