## End of Week Comprehension Questions

1. How do you make a new array? How do you assign that array to a variable? How do you access an element from it? How do you put something in it?
1. How do you make a new hash? How do you assign that hash to a variable? How do you put something into an hash? How do you access a value from it using a key? If you don’t know the keys but you want the values, what can you do?
1. Can you put an array inside of a hash?
    - A hash inside an array?
    - An array in an array?
    - A hash in a hash?
    - How would you “drill down” and access the inner values if you could and did?
1. When making a method, what is the return statement for?
1. Do you have a good example of the following pieces of syntax that you can refer to/copy and paste and replace if you need to? each loop, while loop, until loop, if/elsif/else, case/when statement
1. If you need to make flash cards or a cheat sheet for any of these things, do you have it?
1. Optional: Did you look up how to do a loop table? What would doing a loop table look like for any question on the Data Transformation Worksheet? (We will formally review loop tables in class at some point)
1. Do you have a good strategy to figure out if something evaluates to true or false if in an if-statement? What is your strategy? How can you check in irb?
